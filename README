Projamrex: A projection code for the incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations.

It is based on the AMReX suite of codes - in particular AMReX, IAMR, and Incflo (see https://github.com/AMReX-Codes).

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore , and
Amr directories as well as some routines from IAMR and Incflo.

The directory Exec/tests2d includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  

Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.
